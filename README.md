# **Fitbit Consumer Behaviour Analysis - PrepInsta Internship Week 8 Project**
This project explores the diverse landscape of personal health data captured through wearable technology, focusing on a comprehensive dataset collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12 and May 12, 2016. Contributed by thirty Fitbit users, the data offers minute-level insights into physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns, uniquely identified by export session ID and timestamp. The variations in data output stem from the use of different Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors, providing a rich dataset for nuanced analysis.

## **Project Scope**
The dataset includes 18 distinct files, each capturing various health metrics. This analysis aims to uncover trends in physical activity patterns, caloric expenditure, and sleep quality, shedding light on the intricate interplay between wearable technology and personal health monitoring.

## **Key Findings**
- Daily Activity Trends: Users exhibited variations in daily step counts, total distance, and active minutes. Consistent engagement in very active or fairly active activities was observed in some users, while others showed more variability.

- Hourly Patterns: The data revealed fluctuations in calorie expenditure and total intensity throughout the day, highlighting peak activity hours and sedentary periods.

- Minute-Level Intensity: Granular insights into activity intensity were captured, highlighting moments of increased or decreased intensity for a more nuanced understanding of users' behavior.

## **Conclusion**
The Fitbit consumer behavior analysis has unveiled compelling insights into user engagement and activity patterns. Key trends include increased activity during specific periods, a strong interest in heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking, and notable variations in sleep patterns, including weekend differences. Demographic segmentation further revealed differences in behavior among various groups, offering valuable implications for product enhancement, targeted marketing, and improved user engagement strategies.

Business Implications
Understanding trends is crucial for businesses to stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. Insights from this analysis can inform personalized health and fitness recommendations, future studies exploring correlations with external factors like sleep quality or dietary habits, and strategic planning for product development, digital marketing, and customer engagement.

This analysis serves as a foundation for Fitbit to refine its strategies and continue delivering innovative solutions in the health and fitness tracking market.
